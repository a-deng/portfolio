Have you ever been frustrated with trying to balance cookbooks, phones, or tablets while cooking, or trying to convert recipes to fit your personal dietary needs? SweetSwap solves both problems in one convenient, easy-to-use app right on your Pebble. Simply select the recipe you want from the dessert cookbook and choose what ingredient you'd like to swap out. SweetSwap will provide you with step-by-step cooking instructions and a revised ingredients list. Plus, the Pebble is completely waterproof, so you don't have to worry about getting your recipes wet or dirty as you work.

From new to experienced chefs, SweetSwap is designed to help all people with a passion for cooking and desserts.

SweetSwap is programmed in JavaScript using the CloudPebble. The revised ingredients lists are produced in a separate program in C.
